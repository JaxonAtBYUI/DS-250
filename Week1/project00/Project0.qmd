```{python}
#| label: libraries
#| include: false
import pandas as pd
import altair as alt
import numpy as np

from IPython.display import Markdown
from IPython.display import display
from tabulate import tabulate
```


## Elevator pitch

I can use Pandas and Altair to plot data and work on the assignments in this class.

```{python}
#| label: project data
#| code-summary: Read and format project data
# Include and execute your code here
cars = pd.read_csv('https://github.com/byuidatascience/data4python4ds/raw/master/data-raw/mpg/mpg.csv')
```

__Highlight the grand questions__

## GRAND QUESTION 1

__There isn't exactly a question for this project__

We can see a trend in data about the relationship between engine displacement and the miles per gallon in a given car. While nearly negligible effect on cars with higher displacement, we can surmise through looking at the plotted data that the greater the engine displacement, the lower the miles per gallon.

```{python}
#| label: GQ1 chart
#| code-summary: plot example
#| fig-cap: "Engine Displacement and Highway MPG"
#| fig-align: center
# Include and execute your code here
alt.Chart(cars)\
    .encode(x="displ", y="hwy")\
    .mark_circle()\
    .properties(
        width=800,
        height=300
    )
```

```{python}
#| label: GQ1 table
#| code-summary: Display the data as a table
#| tbl-cap: "A talbe of vehicle make, model, year, and mpg on the highway."
#| tbl-cap-location: top
# Include and execute your code here
print(cars
  .head(5)
  .filter(["manufacturer", "model","year", "hwy"])
  .to_markdown(index=False))
```
